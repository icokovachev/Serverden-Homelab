Welcome to my personal **homelab repository** — a space where I experiment, learn, and document my journey of building and managing a home datacenter. This repo contains notes, configs, and automation scripts I use to keep everything running smoothly.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

- **Proxmox VE** → 2-node datacenter cluster for virtualization  
- **Workhorse Server** → dedicated for **load testing** and stress experiments  
- **Containers** → Docker & LXC (transitioning towards Kubernetes for orchestration)  

---

## 🤖 Automation  

- **Terraform** → provisioning infrastructure  
- **Ansible** → configuration management and service deployment  
- Ongoing: learning how to integrate **Terraform + Ansible** into a unified workflow  

---

## 📊 Monitoring  

- **Prometheus + Grafana** → system metrics and dashboards  
- Exploring: **Loki** (logs) & **Mimir** (metrics at scale) for observability expansion  

---

## 🎬 Media Services  

- **Servarr Stack** (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, etc.) → automated media acquisition  
- Integrated with **streaming + storage** solutions for a seamless home media experience  

---

## 🎯 Goals  

- Build a **resilient, production-like environment** at home  
- Learn and apply **DevOps & SRE practices** in a hands-on way  
- Automate everything possible — from provisioning to monitoring  
- Share configs and notes to help others interested in homelabs  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap  

- [ ] Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration  
- [ ] Expand monitoring stack with Loki & Mimir  
- [ ] Full integration of Terraform + Ansible workflows  
- [ ] Improve CI/CD pipelines for service deployments  
- [ ] Document disaster recovery & backup strategy
